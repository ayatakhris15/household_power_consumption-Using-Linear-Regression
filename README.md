⚡ Electricity Consumption Prediction using Linear Regression
📌 Project Overview

This project predicts household electricity consumption using Linear Regression based on historical numerical energy data.
It demonstrates a complete machine learning pipeline, including data preprocessing, feature scaling, model training, prediction, and evaluation.

The project is implemented in Python and executed on Google Colab, using the UCI Electric Power Consumption Dataset.

📈 Model Evaluation
🔹 Regression Prediction

The model predicts continuous electricity consumption values using Linear Regression.

🔹 Binary Evaluation (Optional)

For demonstration purposes, predicted values are converted into:

High Consumption

Low Consumption

This is done using the mean of the target variable as a threshold, allowing the use of:

Accuracy

Confusion Matrix

Classification Report

⚠️ Note:
Accuracy and confusion matrix are classification metrics.
For regression problems, metrics such as R², MAE, and MSE are more appropriate.
Binary evaluation is included only to demonstrate classification-style analysis.

✅ Results

Accuracy: 99.44%

Model shows strong predictive performance

Predictions are well-aligned with actual consumption values

Scatter plot confirms a strong linear relationship

📊 Visualization

The following visualization is included:

Actual vs Predicted Electricity Consumption Scatter Plot

This helps verify how closely the model predictions match real values.
